# Stress-Motivation-Web-Page
Our Team created a webpage aimed at helping university and college students understand and manage stress and anxiety related to their studies. Initially built using HTML, CSS and Javascript, I am progressively integrating JavaScript as I continue learning. This website will be a valuable resource for students to educate themselves about stress management and find strategies to cope effectively.
